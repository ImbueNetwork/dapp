                        You are not currently logged in and we were unable to find a web3 extension.
                        Make sure that you have the
                        <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/" target="_blank">
                            Polkadot{.js} extension</a>
                        installed, and that you have created an account with an $IMBU balance
                        sufficient to make transactions.

                    <p>
                        Or, you can choose to sign in now using one of the web 2.0 services
                        below. This will only allow you to save a draft of your proposal
                        for editing. If you wish to have your project funded, you will
                        eventually need to have the above web3 extension, an account, and
                        enough $IMBU to make the transaction.
