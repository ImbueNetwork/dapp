    You can choose to sign in now using either a web3 extension or one of the
    web 2.0 services below. However, this is only intended as a convenience
    to allow you to save a draft of your proposal for editing and sharing on
    another browser or computer. It's optional, and you can also choose to
    simply continue using local storage to edit on this browser before
    finalization.

    Note that, if you wish to have your project funded, you will eventually
    need to have the <a href="#">polkadot{.js}</a> web3 extension and enough
    $IMBU to make the transaction.

    <strong>For now, the contents of the grant submission form have
    been saved to your browser's local storage</strong>. This means that you
    won't be able to view and/or edit your draft on another browser or
    computer. However, you will be able to submit the draft to the Imbue
    Network blockchain as long as you have the polkadot{.js} extension.
    
    If you do decide to create an account, after you've signed up and logged
    in, you will either be redirected back to this page, or you can refresh
    and/or navigate here yourself whenever you want.
